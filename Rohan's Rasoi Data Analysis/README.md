# Rohan's Rasoi Data Analysis

## Introduction

Rohan has a deep passion for Indian cuisine, which inspired him to open **Rohan's Rasoi**â€”a cozy restaurant serving his three favorite dishes: biryani, dosa, and chaat. Launched at the beginning of 2021, Rohan's Rasoi aims to provide a delightful dining experience, but needs help leveraging its data to ensure success.

## Problem Statement

Rohan's Rasoi has collected some basic data over its initial months of operation. To help the restaurant thrive, we need to analyze this data to answer key questions about customer behavior, spending patterns, and menu preferences. These insights will guide decisions on expanding the customer loyalty program and improving the overall dining experience.

## Objectives

- **Customer Insights:** Determine how often customers visit, how much they spend, and which menu items are their favorites.
- **Data Analysis:** Use SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as customer spending patterns and popular menu items.
- **Loyalty Program:** Assess whether expanding the existing customer loyalty program would be beneficial.

## Key Datasets Provided

To perform the analysis, the following datasets are provided:

- **sales:** Records of all sales transactions, including customer IDs, product IDs, prices, and sale dates.
- **menu:** Details of the menu items, including product IDs, names, and prices.
- **members:** Information about customers who are members of the loyalty program, including customer IDs and join dates.

## SQL Queries

- Total amount each customer spent at the restaurant
- Number of unique items purchased by each customer
- Average amount spent per visit by each customer
- Most popular menu item across all customers
- Most expensive item purchased by each customer
- Most popular day of the week for customer visits
